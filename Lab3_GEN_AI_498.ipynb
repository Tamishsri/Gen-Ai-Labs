            "The core principles of Zero Trust Architecture are based on the idea that trust is not inherent, and all interactions must be verified and validated in real-time. This approach differs from traditional network security, which often relies on a perimeter-based defense and trusts all users and devices within the network. In a Zero Trust Architecture, the network is considered hostile, and all traffic is treated as untrusted, regardless of whether it originates from inside or outside the network.\n",

            "Zero Trust Architecture emphasizes the importance of identity and access control, using techniques such as multi-factor authentication, least privilege access, and continuous authorization. This approach ensures that users and devices are authenticated and authorized based on their identity, role, and context, rather than their location or network segment. Additionally, Zero Trust Architecture incorporates attributes such as user behavior, device posture, and environmental factors to make informed access decisions.\n",

These components work together to provide a robust security posture by verifying the identity and authenticity of users and devices, controlling access to resources based on policy, and continuously monitoring and analyzing traffic for potential threats. Other key technologies, such as software-defined perimeters (SDPs) and cloud access security brokers (CASBs), also play a crucial role in enabling Zero Trust Architecture.\n",
